This project contains my solution for the **“SenNet + HOA – Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D”**
Kaggle challenge, which focuses on segmenting blood vessels in large 3D TIFF scans of human kidneys.

---

## 🔍 Summary

Given massive 3D volumes, the goal is to produce voxel-wise vessel masks that can be used to study
vascular morphology and support the Human Reference Atlas effort. The main challenges are:

- 40GB+ of volumetric data per competition bundle.
- Highly imbalanced vessel vs. background classes.
- Tight GPU memory constraints for 3D convolutions.

---

## 🧠 Method

- A **3D U-Net** architecture for volumetric segmentation.
- Training and inference pipelines tailored to:
  - Patch-based processing of large volumes.
  - Careful memory management on commodity GPUs.
- Post-processing that converts predicted masks to **run-length encoded (RLE)** strings to match
  Kaggle’s submission format.
