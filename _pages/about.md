I’m an undergraduate student at UW–Madison majoring in Statistics, Data Science, and Mathematics with the Data Science named option. My academic interests center on representation learning for biomedical data, including molecular graphs, protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks, and gene expression profiles. I care about methods that are bothI’m a undergraduate student in Statistics, Data Science, and Mathematics with Data Science named option at UW–Madison interested in representation learning for biomedical data (molecular graphs, PPI networks, and gene expression). I care about methods that are both **theoretically grounded** and **directly useful** in drug discovery and repurposing pipelines.

Outside of research, I enjoy playing [TFT](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/)
