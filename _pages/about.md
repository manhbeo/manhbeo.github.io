Hi! I’m **Manh Nguyen**.

I’m a undergraduate student in Statistics, Data Science, and Mathematics with Data Science named option at UW–Madison interested in representation learning for biomedical data (molecular graphs, PPI networks, and gene expression).

My current projects include:
- Semi-supervised contrastive learning with orthonormal prototypes
- Cone-based nonnegative matrix factorization for high-dimensional gene expression
- Graph contrastive learning with spectral graph matching for molecular graphs

I care about methods that are both **theoretically grounded** and **useful in drug discovery and repurposing pipelines**.

Outside of research, I enjoy
